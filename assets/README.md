## Portfolio Page ##

This page was created to showcase my current and future projects all in one convenient place with contact info and a little snapshot of who I am 📷

## Motivation for Creation ##

This is a great way to grow my web presence and show the skills I gain throughout the course and beyond.

## Build Status ##

There are certainly some things that will need fixing on v. 1.0, will advise as the project continues.

## Screenshots ##

Here's the main build:
