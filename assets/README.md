## Portfolio Page ##

This page was created to showcase my current and future projects all in one convenient place with contact info and a little snapshot of who I am üì∑

You can find the project here: https://benwofford.github.io/homework-week-2/

## Motivation for Creation ##

This is a great way to grow my web presence and show the skills I gain throughout the course and beyond.

## Build Status ##

There are certainly some things that will need fixing on v. 1.0, will advise as the project continues.

Update 8/22: I have changed the size of the project 1 card and added a link to the live project in README. I also linked the most recent Password Generator project from week 3.
